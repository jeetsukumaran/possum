POSSUM is a C++ program for calculating some common population genetic summary statistics.

It can calculate these statistics for a single population, in which case it reports:

    - pi (the nucleotide diversity, Hamming distance, or uncorrected p-distance)
    - number of segregating sites
    - number of mutations
    - Watterson's estimate of theta
    - Tajima's D

With multiple populations, it is expected that the input files lists the
sequences group by deme or population, and the '-N' flag is then used to
inform POSSUM about the population membership, by providing a comma-separated
list of the numbers of samples from each populatiin. For example, if the data
has been sampled from three populations, with 10 sequences from the first
population, 15 from the second, and 8 from the third, then the following is
the basic POSSUM invocation for this data to be treated correctly:

    possum -N 10,15,8 data.nex

In this case, in addition to the global statistics reported for a single
population as described above, POSSUM will also report:

    - fst (the fixation index)
    - pi.within (the average of nucleotide diversity *within* each population)
    - pi.between (the average of nucleotide diversity *between* each
      population)
    - pi.total (the average of nucleotide diversity of all populations
      considered together)
    - pi.net (the difference between pi.within and pi.between)

Any data format supported by NCL can be read, including NEXUS, FASTA, PHYLIP,
etc.
By default, output is the form of tab-delimited set of columns, which allows
for easy generation of a flatfile database or table when analyzing multiple
files.
Extra columns can be added to this for identification of sources in
post-processing.
If the table-based output is not desirable (it can, for example, be difficult
to read at a glance), an option allows for output in an extended list.
